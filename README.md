# DF-Capstone-Project
 This is my first project using Data Science and Machine Learning techniques.
 The aim of the project is to predict Spanish Wine price variation using the techniques and tools that I've learned in the 12-week Digital Futures Academy.

# Conclusions:
When evaluating the accuracy of the models on both the training and test sets, it became apparent that the model was over-fitted on the training set.
While this outcome may be expected given the nature of the models used, further investigation is required to address this issue.

Although the current model falls short of accurately predicting the price of wine, there have been valuable insights gained through the process.
One important learning from the project is the feature importance metrics obtained from the model predictions.
The results indicate that the winery where the wine is produced has a greater impact on the price than the type of grape.
Additionally, ratings provided by experts appear to have more impact on the price than alcohol levels or the year of production.
While these assumptions cannot be made with complete certainty, they provide valuable insight into how to further work with this dataset to improve price prediction.

There are several additional factors that could potentially impact the price of wine, including pH levels or acidity, residual sugar, and the optimal point of consumption. These variables were not accounted for during the web scraping process.
The price of wine is also influenced by numerous uncontrollable factors, such as the variability in production resulting from weather and soil conditions, the unpredictable effects of ageing on wine quality and price, and economic factors like market fluctuations, supply and demand.
Given the sheer size of the wine industry, particularly in Spain, it is likely that additional data would be necessary to sufficiently train algorithms for accurately predicting wine prices.
